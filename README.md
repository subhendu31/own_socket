Introduction
Welcome to my first socket project! This project aims to demonstrate basic socket programming concepts by implementing a simple client-server architecture.

Features
Client-Server Communication: The project implements a basic client-server model where the client sends messages to the server, and the server responds to these messages.
Bidirectional Communication: Both the client and server can send messages to each other.
Error Handling: Basic error handling is implemented to handle cases like connection issues or unexpected messages.
